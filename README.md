# offgrid-solar-calculator-ph

Solar calculator ph is an web app designed to compute for the solar materials needed for a solar energy system setup. The objective of this app is to display the total price of the list of materials and how much quantity of those materials needed to build a complete solar energy setup.

In this area the user can set the desired voltage system for their offgrid solar setup. There is also a display for the estimated cost of the setup based from the prices of the materials.

There is total price display that shows how much is the total cost of the setup.

### Summary Section
